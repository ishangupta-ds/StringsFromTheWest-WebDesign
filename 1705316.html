          <h3>Classic</h3>
		
          <p>Rhythm is the variation of the accentuation of sounds or other events over time.“Rhythm involves patterns of duration that are phenomenally present in the music” with duration perceived by interonset interval. When governed by rule, it is called meter. It is inherent in any time-dependent medium, but it is most associated with music, dance, and the majority of poetry.</p>
          <h3>Acoustic</h3>
          <p>An acoustic guitar is a guitar that produces sound acoustically by transmitting the vibration of the strings to the air—as opposed to relying on electronic amplification. The sound waves from the strings of an acoustic guitar resonate through the guitar's body, creating sound. This typically involves the use of a sound board and a sound box to strengthen the vibrations of the strings.</p>
          <h3>Flamenco</h3>
          <p>Made of Spanish cypress and spruce woods, the flamenco guitar is lighter and features somewhat smaller dimensions than its classic counterpart. The result? Its signature sharper - and almost even metallic- sound. There are also some interesting distinguishing features of the flamenco guitar and the way to play it. The rhythms and strumming patterns are clearly different, for example. Instead of sheet music there are rules to playing the Spanish guitar, but mastery requires a good ear and relies heavily on spontaneity and improvisation. Also, instead of a pick guard, you'll notice a slightly different barrier on the guitar which allow the guitarist - or tocaor - to tap his fingers against the guitar while he is playing. The result is a one-man show, as he simultaneously provides melody, percussion, and auditory delight to whoever is lucky enough to be around.</p>

          <h3>Lead</h3>
          <p>Lead guitar is a musical part for a guitar in which the guitarist plays melody lines, instrumental fill passages, guitar solos, and occasionally, some riffs within a song structure. The lead is the featured guitar, which usually plays single-note-based lines or double-stops.In rock, heavy metal, blues, jazz, punk, fusion, some pop, and other music styles, lead guitar lines are usually supported by a second guitarist who plays rhythm guitar, which consists of accompaniment chords and riffs.</p>
          <h3>Picking</h3>
          <p>Guitar picking is a group of hand and finger techniques a guitarist uses to set guitar strings in motion to produce audible notes. These techniques involve plucking, strumming, brushing, etc. Picking can be done with:
            <ul>
               <li>A pick (plectrum) held in the hand</li>
               <li>Natural or artificial fingernails, fingertips or finger-mounted plectrums known as fingerpicks (for techniques collectively known as fingerstyle)</li>
               <li>A plectrum held between thumb and one finger, supplemented by the free fingers—called hybrid picking.</li>
            </ul>
             Using a single thumb pick with the bare fingers is similar to hybrid picking. Another mixed technique is to play different passages with a plectrum or fingerstyle, "palming" the plectrum when not in use.
           </p>
           <h3>Arpeggio</h3>
           <p>A broken chord is a chord broken into a sequence of notes. A broken chord may repeat some of the notes from the chord and span one or more octaves.

              An arpeggio (Italian: [arˈpeddʒo]) is a type of broken chord, in which the notes that compose a chord are played or sung in a rising or descending order. An arpeggio may also span more than one octave.

              <p>The word arpeggio comes from the Italian word arpeggiare, which means to play on a harp.

              Even though the notes of an arpeggio are not played or sung all together at the same time, listeners hear the sequence of notes as forming a chord. When an arpeggio also contains passing tones that are not part of the chord, different music theorists may analyze the same musical excerpt differently.

              Arpeggios enable composers writing for monophonic instruments that play one note at a time (e.g., flute, saxophone, trumpet), to voice chords and chord progressions in musical pieces. Arpeggios and broken chords are also used to help create rhythmic interest. A notable example of which is the Alberti bass figuration which was widely used in piano music from the Classical music period. With an Alberti bass, rather than play the notes of a chord all at once, the pianist plays simple rhythmic figures in which the notes of the chord are played as a broken chord.</p></p>

            <h3>Tapping</h3>
            <p>Tapping is a guitar playing technique where a string is fretted and set into vibration as part of a single motion of being pushed onto the fretboard, as opposed to the standard technique being fretted with one hand and picked with the other.

               It incorporates the techniques of hammer-on and pull-off, but these are usually only performed by the fretting hand, and in conjunction with conventionally picked notes, whereas tap passages involve both hands and consist of only tapped, hammered and pulled notes. Some players (such as Stanley Jordan) rely extensively or exclusively on tapping.

               Tapping is also called tap style (tapstyle), touch-style, and two-handed tapping, though the latter is somewhat of a misnomer as "one-handed tapping" is equivalent to the common hammer-on.

               Tapping is the primary technique intended for some instruments such as the Chapman Stick and is the alternative method for the Warr Guitar and others.</p>
             <h3>Pinch harmonics</h3>
             <p>A pinch harmonic (also known as squelch picking, pick harmonic or squealy) is a guitar technique to achieve artificial harmonics in which the player's thumb or index finger on the picking hand slightly catches the string after it is picked,canceling (silencing) the fundamental frequency of the string, and letting one of the harmonics dominate. This results in a high pitched sound which is particularly discernible on an electrically amplified guitar as a "squeal".</p>
             <h3>Hammer-on</h3>
             <p>A hammer-on is a playing technique performed on a stringed instrument (especially on a fretted string instrument, such as a guitar) by sharply bringing a fretting-hand finger down on the fingerboard behind a fret, causing a note to sound. This technique is the opposite of the pull-off.</p><br><p><a href=https://www.musictheoryforguitar.com>More info</a></p>
